TITLE: LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

ABOUT THIS PROJECT: 
Library is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing. Thus, the process of handling a library manually is very troublesome and clumsy. As regards to this point of view, we plan to develop a computerized system for handling the activities of library management in a comprehensive way to lessen physical labour and reduce complexity of the manual system. 
In this project, we plan on adding many features which are generally not available in a library management system. It will have features like user login, faculty login and admin login. It will also have a facility where student after logging in their accounts can see list of books issued and its issue date and return date and the students can also request the librarian to add new books through a request link.
 Overall, this project is being developed to help the students as well as staff of library to maintain the library in the best way possible and also reduce the human efforts.
 
Problem Statement:

The current library system lacks efficiency in managing the increasing number of books, members, and transactions. The system does not provide a seamless experience for library staff to track the availability of books, issue and return books, and manage fines for late returns. Moreover, the existing system is manual and prone to errors, leading to data inconsistency and delayed service. The library needs a comprehensive Library Management System that can streamline the processes of book acquisition, cataloguing, circulation, and inventory management while providing a user-friendly interface for library staff and members. The system should also have a reporting feature that allows for better decision-making and analytics.
OBJECTIVES:
The Library Management System must have the following functional requirements: 
1.	The LMS should store all information about librarian and other users (students and faculty members) – their login info, books issued, etc. 
2.	The LMS should store all information about the books and users in two separated databases.
3.	The LMS should allow searching books/journals by author, title, keywords or availability. 
4.	The LMS should generate request’s reports for librarian, upon which he/she could make decisions about accepting/rejecting the requests. 
5.	The LMS should allow users to view their personal information and status (numbers of books issued, days left, etc.) 
6.	The LMS should provide modules to search, request and renew books.
7.	The users should be able to view their recent check-ins/checkouts, calculate and clear dues, request/recommend more books, etc. 
8.	The librarian must be able to add/remove books,               manage users, process dues, view recommendations from users, etc.

CONCLUSION:

In conclusion, a Library Management System is an essential tool for modern libraries to efficiently manage their resources and provide seamless services to their users. The system provides a comprehensive platform for acquiring, cataloguing, and circulating library materials, managing user accounts, and generating reports. An online database library management system has the advantage of being accessible from anywhere, anytime, by library staff and users. The future work involved in such a system includes continuous maintenance, integration with external systems, mobile app development, AI integration, big data analytics, user feedback analysis, and cloud computing. By leveraging these technologies, libraries can provide a better experience for their users, optimize their operations, and stay ahead of the curve in an increasingly digital world.
